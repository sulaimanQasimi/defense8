# Uncommitted Changes Report

This document provides a comprehensive description of all the uncommitted changes in the project.

## Modified Files

### 1. `config/auth.php`

**Changes:**
- Modified the password timeout setting from 10800 to 10000800 (seconds)
- This significantly increases the password timeout duration from 3 hours to approximately 115 days

**Security Implications:**
- Extended password timeout reduces the frequency of re-authentication requirements
- This may impact system security by prolonging session validity

### 2. `config/session.php`

**Changes:**
- Reduced session lifetime from 300 minutes to 120 minutes (from 5 hours to 2 hours)
- Changed `expire_on_close` setting from `true` to `false`

**Implications:**
- Sessions now expire after 2 hours instead of 5 hours
- Sessions will no longer expire when the browser is closed, allowing users to return to existing sessions

### 3. `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`

**Changes:**
- Added a new seeder call `GunCardConfirmationPermissionSeeder` in the `run()` method

**Implications:**
- Adds new permissions for gun card confirmation functionality

### 4. `package/sq/Card/src/Http/Controllers/contracts/PrintSettings.php`

**Changes:**
- Updated the `gun()` method to check for confirmation status
- Added a condition `if ($gunCard->printed || !$gunCard->confirmed) { abort(404); }` that prevents printing unconfirmed gun cards

**Implications:**
- Gun cards must now be confirmed before they can be printed
- Provides an additional security layer for gun card issuance

### 5. `package/sq/Employee/src/Models/GunCard.php`

**Changes:**
- Added new fields to the model: `confirmed` and `confirmed_by`
- Added these fields to the `$fillable` array
- Added `confirmed` to `$casts` array as boolean
- Added a new relationship method `confirmedByUser()` that links to the User model

**Implications:**
- Enables tracking of gun card confirmation status
- Associates confirmations with specific users for accountability

### 6. `package/sq/Employee/src/Nova/GunCard.php`

**Changes:**
- Added new fields to the resource:
  - `Boolean::make(__("Confirmed"), 'confirmed')` with permission checks
  - `BelongsTo::make(__('Confirmed By'), 'confirmedByUser', User::class)`
- Added a new filter `ConfirmedFilter` to the filters array
- Added a new action `ConfirmGunCardAction` to the actions array
- Modified print actions to check for confirmation status
- Updated permissions to accommodate the new confirmation workflow

**Implications:**
- Provides UI for gun card confirmation workflow
- Restricts printing of gun cards to only confirmed cards
- Adds filtering capabilities based on confirmation status

## New Files

### 1. `database/migrations/2023_10_15_000001_add_confirmation_to_gun_cards.php`

**Changes:**
- Creates a migration to add confirmation-related fields to the gun_cards table
- Adds:
  - `confirmed` boolean field defaulting to false
  - `confirmed_by` foreign key linking to users table

**Implications:**
- Database structure is updated to support the confirmation workflow
- Ensures data integrity with proper constraints and defaults

### 2. `database/seeders/GunCardConfirmationPermissionSeeder.php`

**Changes:**
- Creates a new seeder that adds two new permissions:
  - `confirm-gun-card`: Allows users to confirm gun cards
  - `view-gun-card-confirmation`: Allows users to view confirmation status

**Implications:**
- Establishes role-based access control for the confirmation feature
- Enables granular permission assignment for different user roles

### 3. `package/sq/Employee/src/Nova/Actions/ConfirmGunCardAction.php`

**Changes:**
- Implements a Nova action that allows authorized users to confirm gun cards
- Sets the confirmed flag to true and records the confirming user's ID
- Includes permission checks to ensure only authorized users can confirm cards

**Implications:**
- Provides the functionality for confirming gun cards in the admin interface
- Ensures proper user attribution for accountability

### 4. `package/sq/Employee/src/Nova/Filters/ConfirmedFilter.php`

**Changes:**
- Implements a boolean filter for the Nova interface
- Allows filtering gun cards by confirmation status (confirmed or not confirmed)

**Implications:**
- Improves user experience by enabling easy identification of confirmed and unconfirmed gun cards
- Facilitates management of the confirmation workflow

## Summary

These changes implement a comprehensive confirmation workflow for gun cards in the system. Key aspects of the update include:

1. **Database Changes**: Adding confirmation status and user tracking to the gun cards table
2. **Permission System**: Creating specific permissions for confirming and viewing confirmation status
3. **UI Enhancements**: Adding filters and actions in the Nova admin interface
4. **Process Flow Modification**: Requiring confirmation before printing gun cards
5. **Security Improvements**: Ensuring only authorized users can confirm gun cards
6. **Authentication Changes**: Adjustments to session and password timeout settings

The update establishes a more controlled and secure process for gun card issuance, with clear accountability through user attribution of confirmations. The feature is fully integrated with the existing permission system, ensuring proper access control.
