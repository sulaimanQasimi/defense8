# System Architecture

## High-Level Architecture
Defense8 is built using a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes reusability. The system employs a combination of Laravel's built-in MVC architecture with additional patterns like Repository Pattern and Service Pattern.

```
[Client] <-> [Web/API Layer] <-> [Service Layer] <-> [Repository Layer] <-> [Database]
```

## Architecture Components

### Web/API Layer
The web layer consists of controllers, middleware, and views that handle the HTTP requests and responses. This layer is responsible for:
- Request validation
- Authentication and authorization
- Response formatting
- Route definitions (in `routes/` directory)

### Service Layer
The service layer contains business logic and coordinates the interaction between controllers and repositories. Services are found in:
- `app/Services/`
- Custom package services in `package/sq/*/src/Services/`

### Repository Layer
The repository layer handles data access and abstracts the database interactions. This promotes testability and separation of concerns:
- `app/Repositories/`
- Custom package repositories in `package/sq/*/src/Repositories/`

### Models
Models represent the database tables and handle the relationships between different entities:
- Core models in `app/Models/`
- Custom package models in `package/sq/*/src/Models/`

## Design Patterns

The system uses several design patterns to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability:

1. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data layer, making it easier to swap out the database or data source.
2. **Service Pattern**: Encapsulates business logic in dedicated service classes.
3. **Observer Pattern**: Used for model events and listeners.
4. **Strategy Pattern**: Implemented in various components where behavior needs to be switchable.
5. **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating complex objects especially in Nova resources.

## Technology Stack Details

### Backend
- **PHP 8.2+**: Programming language
- **Laravel 10.x**: Web framework
- **Laravel Nova**: Admin panel framework
- **Laravel Sanctum**: API authentication
- **Laravel Reverb**: WebSockets server
- **Laravel Telescope**: Debugging and monitoring
- **Spatie Packages**: Permissions, Media Library, etc.

### Frontend
- **Vue.js 3.x**: JavaScript framework
- **Inertia.js**: Server-side rendering framework
- **Livewire**: Server-driven frontend
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Alpine.js**: Lightweight JavaScript framework
- **Feather Icons**: Icon library

### Storage
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Primary database
- **Redis**: Caching, queues, and pub/sub
- **Laravel Storage**: File storage abstraction

### DevOps
- **Laravel Forge/Envoyer**: Deployment tools
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD
- **Docker**: Containerization (optional)

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- HTTP/HTTPS API endpoints for client-server communication
- Internal service-to-service calls

### Asynchronous Communication
- Laravel Queues for background processing
- Laravel Events for system events
- WebSockets for real-time updates via Laravel Reverb

## Security Architecture

The system implements several security measures:
- Role-based access control via Laravel Nova and custom policies
- Authentication via Laravel Sanctum for APIs
- CSRF protection for web routes
- Input validation using Laravel's Form Request Validation
- Encrypted storage for sensitive information
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

## Scalability Considerations

The application is designed with scalability in mind:
- Horizontal scaling through stateless application servers
- Queue workers for background processing
- Caching strategies for database queries and responses
- Database indexing for performance
- Load balancing capabilities
